Carl,

This is Todd Osbourne.   I am a Chemist in the Louisville R&amp;D dept working on process scale up
work.  I got your name from Victor Johnston here in Louisville who asked me to reach out to you
regarding a data formatting issue we have with data files from our Eirich mixers.  Victor
indicated that you are part of the digitalization team so I am hoping you can help.

We have two different Eirich mixers here in Louisville R&amp;D.  Once is a 1 L mixer (Eirich EL1
data file attached).  This mixer outputs data in a way that is easy to understand and graph in
Excel.  The other mixer is an Eirich EL 10 (10 L mixer).  The data from that 10 L mixer is
attached as the file “Data_log10.txt”.   The format of the data in this file is much different than
the EL1 file.  Ultimately we’d like to be able to get the data from the two mixers in exactly the
same format so we can compare them directly (visualize in Excel simple graphs, etc).  We have
reached out to the vendor with no help from them yet, and attempted to do some basic
transformation of the EL10 data in excel but are struggling to consistently get the data in the
same format (and without errors/missing data, etc) when transforming the data file.  

I am hoping you (or someone from the digitalization team) can help with setting up some sort of
transformation template  to convert the data…. Not specifically interested in the attached data
files…. But more interested in having a solution that works for transforming these data files as
we generate mixing data going forward.

Please let me know if you have questions regarding this…. If needed we can set up a call to
discuss. 

Todd
